## 🚩 Problem Statement

Rural diploma colleges often lack subject lecturers in advanced domains such as **Artificial Intelligence**, **VLSI**, and **Renewable Energy**.  
Students are left to depend on self-study or costly city-based coaching, widening the **urban-rural learning gap**.

Existing online education solutions fail due to **unstable, low-bandwidth connectivity** and the need for **complex infrastructure**.  
There is a critical need for a **lightweight, software-only virtual classroom ecosystem** that ensures:
- Clear audio and compressed visuals  
- Offline-accessible recordings  
- Interactive quizzes and discussion boards  
- Optimized performance for entry-level smartphones and minimal data usage  

The solution must be **simple for faculty**, **affordable for institutions**, and **sustainable in low-resource environments**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a **low-bandwidth optimized virtual classroom system**.  
- Ensure **audio-first delivery** with compressed visuals for clarity.  
- Provide both **live interaction** and **offline access** to lectures.  
- Enable **interactive features** (quizzes, polls, discussion boards).  
- Design a **mobile-friendly**, **simple**, and **cost-effective** solution.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**EduBridge** is a **software-only virtual classroom platform** designed to deliver seamless learning experiences in low-connectivity environments.  
It enables **real-time interaction**, **recorded sessions**, and **AI-based engagement monitoring**, without requiring expensive hardware or high-speed internet.
